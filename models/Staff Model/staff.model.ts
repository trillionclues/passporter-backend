//   // When querying applications and populating the applicant field
//   const applications = await ApplicationModel.find().populate('applicant');

// Create a new model for staff members with the following fields:

// Staff ID: A unique identifier for the staff member.

// First Name: The staff member's first name.

// Last Name: The staff member's last name.

// Role: The staff member's role (passport officer, visa officer, etc.).

// Permissions: A list of permissions for the staff member, such as approving passport applications, reviewing visa applications, etc.

// Additionally, you'll need to implement logic to manage the passport application queue and staff review process. This may involve creating separate endpoints for submitting passport applications, viewing the queue, and reviewing applications.
